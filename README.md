# GreyBoxModel: Indoor Environmental Control via Grey Box Modeling

## Overview

The **GreyBoxModel** repository is dedicated to advancing the science and practice of Indoor Environmental Control through the power of Grey Box Modeling. As the demand for energy-efficient, comfortable, and healthy indoor spaces continues to rise, the need for accurate and adaptive modeling solutions becomes paramount.

This project harnesses Grey Box Modeling to bridge the gap between physics-based models and data-driven methods, offering precise control and optimization for various indoor environmental settings. Whether you're an academic researcher or a professional in building automation, this repository provides essential tools and models to improve energy efficiency, comfort, and health within indoor environments.

## Features

- **Hybrid Modeling Approach**: Combines both physics-based and data-driven methodologies.
- **Indoor Environmental Control**: Specifically designed to optimize HVAC systems, air quality, and thermal comfort.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Focus on reducing energy consumption while maintaining ideal indoor conditions.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for both small residential setups and large commercial buildings.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Detailed guides, examples, and best practices for applying Grey Box Models to your projects.

## Installation

To get started, you need to have Python installed. This project requires several dependencies which can be installed via `conda` or `pip`.

### Using Conda (Recommended)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate greyboxmodel
```

### Using Pip

If you prefer to use pip, you can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can explore the examples and notebooks provided within the `notebooks/` directory to get a hands-on introduction to Grey Box Modeling.

To execute the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/greyboxmodel.git
   cd greyboxmodel
   ```

2. Set up your environment as described in the installation section.

3. Run the sample notebooks located in the `notebooks/` directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/ExampleNotebook.ipynb
   ```
